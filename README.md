Gratis PHP Assessment

# Getting started
The assessment asked me to use XAMPP. However:
1. I wanted to play with Phalcon since you mentioned using it in the interview.
2. I use a Mac for development and I wanted to see if Docker would help standardize the environment.

I built a Docker container to install Phalcon 5.6.0 with PHP 8.2 via XAMPP.

1. Install docker-desktop
2. Run docker-desktop (background)
3. In a terminal:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in browser
